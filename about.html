            My name is <strong>Nor Adriana Aqilah binti Ismail@Ibrahim</strong>, and I’m currently a second-semester student pursuing a 
            <strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Information System Management</strong>. My mom is a housewife while my dad is FELDA settler. I’m the <strong> youngest </strong>of seven siblings. I have 4 brothers and 2 sisters and grew up in a loving 
            and supportive family that has always encouraged me to learn, grow, and dream big. I have grumpy yet clingy cat, Cheetah. My dream since I was a kid is to become a lecturer. I hope to one day be part of the academic world, guiding and inspiring future students to reach their full potential.
        </p>

            I love watching <strong>K-Dramas</strong> and listening to music to relax and find inspiration. I love listening to any genre of 
            songs especially Kpop. My all time favourite healing song is “Butterfly” by <strong>BTS</strong> 💜
